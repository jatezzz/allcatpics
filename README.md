## Project Plan and Architecture Overview

### Requirements Given

The project commenced with a specific objective and key pages in mind, detailed as follows:

- **Objective**: Build a simple iOS app using Swift that showcases a List Page and a Detail Page. The app should
  leverage Swift's capabilities to provide a user-friendly experience on iOS devices.

- **Key Pages**:
    - **List Page**: This page is required to display at least ten items from a provided JSON dataset. The display
      should include critical, high-level information about each item to engage users and provide valuable insights at a
      glance.
    - **Detail Page**: Upon selecting an item from the List Page, the app should navigate to a Detail Page. This page
      will fetch and display detailed information about the selected item from an external public API.

### UI Scaffold

### Base Model Identified

For handling the data effectively, a base model `Cat` was identified and structured as follows:

```swift
struct Cat: Identifiable, Decodable, Hashable {
    let tags: [String]
    let createdAt: String?
    let updatedAt: String?
    let mimetype: String?
    let size: Int?
    let id: String
    let editedAt: String?

    var displayName: String = ""

    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case tags, createdAt, updatedAt, mimetype, size, editedAt
        case id = "_id"
    }
}
```

This model serves as the foundation for both the List Page and Detail Page, ensuring that the app can handle the JSON
data efficiently and display it in a user-friendly manner.

### API Integration

A critical aspect of the project involved identifying and integrating an external public API to fetch detailed data for
the selected item. The selected API offers several endpoints:

* **Fetch with limit**: `https://cataas.com/api/cats?limit=1000`
* **Fetch info**: `https://cataas.com/cat/[:id]?json=true`
* **Fetch image**: `https://cataas.com/cat/[:id]`
* **Fetch Image with Text**: `https://cataas.com/cat/[:id]/says/[:text]`

Documentation for the API is available at `https://cataas.com/doc.html`, providing guidance on how to effectively
leverage the API for fetching data.

**API Integration Strategy**:

* Plan to integrate the API and handle data fetching, including managing error handling and loading states, to ensure a
  seamless user experience.
* Implement efficient data fetching mechanisms to retrieve detailed information for the Detail Page, utilizing
  the `Fetch info` endpoint.
* Explore additional features, such as fetching images with or without text, to enhance the app's functionality and user
  engagement.

This comprehensive approach to API integration aims to ensure that the app not only meets the initial requirements but
also provides a platform for future enhancements and scalability.

### Architecture Finalization

In the final stages of architectural planning, a decision was made to adopt a **Clean Architecture** approach combined
with aspects of **VIPER**, creating a hybrid architecture that leverages the strengths of both methodologies. This
decision was guided by the desire to segregate the app into distinct layers: presentation, domain, data, and model. You
can learn more about Clean Architecture here.

The **presentation layer** utilizes SwiftUI views alongside ViewModels, a choice that significantly enhances testability
and allows for a more modular design. SwiftUI's declarative syntax and data-driven approach make it an ideal fit for
building responsive and state-driven UIs, while the use of ViewModels facilitates a clear separation of concerns, with
business logic neatly encapsulated away from the UI layer.

To manage dependencies effectively, a **Dependency Injection Container** was implemented. This container simplifies the
management of dependencies, ensuring that components are loosely coupled and can be easily replaced or mocked during
testing. This approach enhances the scalability and maintainability of the app.

A custom **Navigation Controller** was developed to manage routing within the app. This controller allows for flexible
navigation between views, supporting complex user flows while maintaining a clear and intuitive interface. It's
particularly important in SwiftUI, where navigation can be managed programmatically to align with the app's
architectural patterns.

Additionally, an innovative **algorithm** was introduced to transform raw IDs from the backend into formats that are
more natural and user-friendly, even when read by assistive technologies like VoiceOver. This consideration ensures that
the app is accessible to a broader audience, including those with visual impairments.

To support the processing needs of the app, various **support views** were crafted. These views are designed to handle
specific tasks or display certain types of content, contributing to a clean and organized codebase.

Below is a visual representation of the initial proposed architecture:

![architecure.svg](architecure.svg)

And finally the current one:

![Current_Architecture.svg](Current_Architecture.svg)

This architecture not only adheres to best practices in software development but also caters to the specific needs of
the project. By combining the structured approach of Clean Architecture with the role-specific focus of VIPER, and
embracing SwiftUI for the presentation layer, the project sets a solid foundation for a scalable, maintainable, and
testable iOS app.

## Guidelines for Developers
